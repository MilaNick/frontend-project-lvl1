## The Mind Games project
The Mind Games project is a set of five console games that allow you to improve brain function. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and it is suggested to go through it again.  

## Installation

## Games:
